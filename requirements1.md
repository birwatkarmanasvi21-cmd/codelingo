# Product Name
Thinking-First AI Learning App

# Problem Statement
Most programming learning apps focus on syntax and solutions. Students repeatedly fail because they choose the wrong approach before coding, receive feedback too late, and never understand why their thinking was incorrect.

This app solves that by forcing users to reason before coding and by using AI to diagnose thinking errors, not just syntax mistakes.

# Target Users
- College students (beginner to intermediate)
- Internship and placement focused learners
- Users struggling with DSA thinking, debugging, and approach selection

# Core Subjects
- Programming fundamentals (Python, Java, JavaScript)
- DSA basics
- Logic and problem-solving

# Core Features

## Onboarding & Personalization
- AI asks user goals, level, and daily time
- Generates a personalized learning path

## Core Learning Loop
Each lesson includes:
1. AI explanation (simple language, examples, analogies)
2. Interactive practice (MCQs, fill blanks, predict output)
3. Mistake-based AI feedback explaining *why* answers are wrong
4. Gamified reward (XP, streaks, progress)

## Thinking Lock™ (Key Differentiator)
- Code editor hidden initially
- User must choose an approach and explain logic
- AI evaluates thinking before unlocking coding

## Infinite Parsons Problems
- Drag-and-drop code ordering puzzles
- Indentation-aware
- AI generates infinite variations based on weak areas

## Debug Hunter Minigame
- One bug per code snippet
- User identifies faulty line and fix
- Time-limited and gamified

## AI Code Error Finder
- User pastes code or uploads file
- AI detects errors, explains them, and suggests fixes
- Follow-up practice question generated

## Real-World Usage Context
- Every lesson ends with where the concept is used in real applications

## Gamification
- Streaks
- XP
- Weekly leaderboards (Bronze / Silver / Gold)

## Mini Hackathons (Limited Scope)
- Short 15–30 min challenges
- Focus on approach and reasoning
- AI acts as mentor and evaluator
